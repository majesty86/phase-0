# Git Definitions

##Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

###What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    *Definition* Version control helps to organize different versions of a project, to eliminate confusion and allow many people to work on the same project at once.  
    *Why is it useful?* On a large project, it's useful and usually necessary to have many hands at work in order to finish in good time.  It's also useful if mistakes are made, since previous versions act as a backup.

###What is a branch and why would you use one?
    *Definition* A branch starts a separate copy of the master repository, one whose changes will not effect the master branch.  
    *Why use it?* Keeping branches separate from the master repo makes for cleaner code and again helps to eliminate confusion among other members of a project team.  Branches also allow multiple people to work on the same project without 'stepping on each other's toes.'

###What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    *Definition* A commit is a save point.  If things go haywire, a programmer can go back to this commit to start fresh.  It also cements changes made when other branches are merged back into the master repo.
    *Good commit message* A good commit message is very descriptive, stating exactly what changes are made at that save point.  Good commit messages are also written in present tense.

###What is a merge conflict?
    *Definition* A merge conflict happens when two or more branches tried to change the same thing or delete something another kept when merging back into the master branch.  This would prevent code from running cleanly.  To fix a merge conflict, different software tools can be used, and the parties at conflict should communicate effectively to solve the problem.
