#Learning jQuery

**How I'll do it**

For this challenge, I don't think I have to really re-invent the wheel when it comes to learning.  I plan on finding some videos - I've browsed DBC's Phase 0 app and those seem to be fairly recent and probably helpful.  I'll try to find videos where there's code being written, and code along, because that's greatly helped me in Phase 0 to this point.

**Breaks?**

Early on in Phase 0, I learned about the Pomodoro technique.  I've never really followed it to the letter, because I don't really work well with the idea of breaks every __ minutes.  Different things take different amounts of time.  I break when I feel "fried", meaning when I don't understand something, or when I feel things are getting a bit too tedious.  During the project portion of this challenge, I'll push through the 45 minutes or so if it's just 'work'.  If it's confusing, I'll stop and take a breather.  It always seemed difficult to bring myself to that point, but 100% time throughout Phase 0, when I've taken a break due to confusion, I've come back and figured things out almost instantly.  Funny how the brain works.

**Other resources?**

I suppose my notes here will be a basic resource overview of what has worked for me in the past, and what I think about a certain resource.

*Live-code videos*
This, by far, has helped me the most.  Seeing and interacting at the same time is my most effective way to learn something.  So I will hopefully be finding plenty of these for jQuery.

*Stack Overflow*
Stack Overflow is...overrated to me.  Its sheer size and amount of content is a double-edged sword.  Yes, it covers everything, but it's very hard to read most of the time, and the fact that there's usually multiple solutions can be very confusing.  I've also found that most of the time, the variables that are used can be quite confusing as well.  It's rare I've actually found working solutions on Stack Overflow, and because of that I try to avoid it.

*W3 Schools*
The best resource I've found so far for front-end development.  Not only is everything nicely organized, but you can try everything.  This is gold.

*Google*
Now that I've learned to ask better questions, Google has been great, and I'll turn to it usually for a solution to an obscure problem I can't find on my usual sites.

Alright, here we go!
