# INSERTION-SORT ALGORITHM

# for j <- 2 to length[A]
  # do key ,- A[j]
    # Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A [1..j-1]
    # i <- j-1
    # while i > 0 and A[i] > key
      # do A[i+1] ,- A[i]
        # i <- i-1
    # A[i + 1] <- key  

[4, 12, 1, 9, 30, 2]    

[1, 2, 4, 9, 12, 30]

# Create empty result array
# For each number in the array
# If result array is empty, put number from loop inside empty result array.
  # After first loop, array will have '4' inside it.
# If next number is less 

## Print constantly when trying it out.

# Start with Outermost loop, work your way in.
