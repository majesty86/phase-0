    <p>A tiger would <em>NOT</em> be an ideal housecat.  Some good reasons for that would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They eat deer, pigs, and antelope (might be difficult to keep those around)</li>
        <li>They <strong>EAT</strong> other animals</li>
        <li>Being wild animals, they need much more space than domestic housecats</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <p>However, some pet owners want the thrill of owning a cat from the wild.  Luckily, there are many <em>hybrid</em> cat breeds to choose from nowadays.  Here are some popular examples:</p>
