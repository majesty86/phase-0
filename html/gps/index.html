<!--
1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags, and which ones are most useful?
For people with disabilities to still use websites.  Main, and article/header tags would be most useful, to find exactly the content you're looking for.
2. What order does the browser display elements on a page?
In a hierarchical order, with the biggest parent on top.  For example, everything is nested in the HTML tag, then header with information about the page, then the body with the content.
3. What did you learn about Sublime?  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets?
I learned how to make a snippet, which is something I tried to do week 1 but didn't really understand.  I'll definitely make more - as many as possible!
4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
The hierarchy of semantic elements.  I think using the 'book' reference can help me to understand.  Relating to real life things makes coding concepts stick better. -->
